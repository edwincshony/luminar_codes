# Day 6: User Name Generator

# Write a function called `user_name` that generates a username from the user’s email. The code should ask the user to input an email and the code should return everything before the `@` sign as their user name.

# For example, if someone enters `ben@gmail.com`, the code should return `ben` as their user name.

def user_name():

    email = input("Enter the email: ")

    result = email.split("@")[0]

    return result

print(user_name())
